    "overall_summary": "Tin Nguyen is a strong candidate with 10+ years of full-stack development experience, demonstrating proficiency in critical technologies including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and multiple backend frameworks (Python, Node.js, .NET). However, the resume lacks explicit evidence of some important modern practices such as testing methodologies, CI/CD pipelines, cloud platforms, containerization, and microservices architecture. The candidate shows proven delivery of production applications and technical architecture experience, particularly at the Staff Engineer level.",
