## Executive Summary

### Top 3 Candidates

1. **Oli Treadwell** - Score: 86.05/100
   - Criteria Met: 25/29
   - Oli Treadwell is a strong candidate with 10+ years of professional software development experience, demonstrating excellent proficiency in critical requirements including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and multiple backend technologies (Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails). The candidate has proven leadership through mentoring, teaching roles, and architectural decision-making, with measurable impacts including 15% engagement increases and 100% YoY growth. Primary gaps are in microservices architecture, NoSQL databases, and cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP), though the candidate shows strong fundamentals in CI/CD, testing practices, and scalable architecture design. Overall, this is a highly qualified senior engineer with exceptional communication skills and demonstrated ability to deliver high-quality, tested code.

2. **Daniel Phang** - Score: 73.26/100
   - Criteria Met: 21/29
   - Daniel Phang is a strong candidate with 9+ years of software engineering experience at top-tier companies (Microsoft, Amazon), demonstrating expertise in backend development, cloud platforms (AWS), databases (SQL and NoSQL), and scalable system architecture. However, critical gaps exist for this full-stack senior role: no documented experience with TypeScript or modern frontend frameworks (React/Vue/Angular), no explicit testing/code quality practices mentioned, and missing containerization (Docker/Kubernetes) experience. While backend and infrastructure skills are excellent, the lack of modern frontend technology experience is a significant concern for a full-stack position.

3. **Tin Nguyen** - Score: 56.98/100
   - Criteria Met: 15/29
   - Tin Nguyen is a strong candidate with 10+ years of full-stack development experience, demonstrating proficiency in critical technologies including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and multiple backend frameworks (Python, Node.js, .NET). However, the resume lacks explicit evidence of some important modern practices such as testing methodologies, CI/CD pipelines, cloud platforms, containerization, and microservices architecture. The candidate shows proven delivery of production applications and technical architecture experience, particularly at the Staff Engineer level.
